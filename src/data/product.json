        "Description": "Vermont Green Magic full-spectrum CBD salves are crafted in very small batches and are hand poured with great care. They contain olive, hempseed, and jojoba oils that all work together to nourish and support skin health. Olive oil has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and emollient properties and is rich in vitamins. Hempseed oil is rich in Omegas 3, 6, and 9, and helps soothe and hydrate the skin in addition to aiding the process of repairing skin barriers. Jojoba oil \u2013 the only plant in the world which produces esters that balance the skin\u2019s own sebum cells \u2013 is anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and protects against UV damage. Our salves nourish the skin and moisturize without being waxy or greasy.\r\n\r\nOur salves are micro-crafted with essential oils, all carefully chosen so that each salve has its own distinctive focus.\r\n\r\nBy themselves, essential oils can be powerful healers with complex molecular structures, but when they are used in concert with each other they interact synergistically so that the whole becomes much more than the sum of its parts.\r\n\r\nThe combination of unique essential oil blends with our whole-plant CBD-infused oil is a dynamic process which then becomes a dynamic product. And with a truly full-spectrum salve, it isn\u2019t just the CBD cannabinoid acting to provide relief \u2013 it\u2019s that the whole range of cannabinoids is naturally made available to work for the body.  \r\n\r\nMany people need their products to be fragrance-free. If you would like to order a fragrance-free salve, please contact us and we will be happy to ship it. Custom blends upon request! Tell us what you are specifically looking for.",

                "Description": "Therapeutic CBD oil is designed to be taken internally, either by itself or in conjunction with CBD salves for increased effect and potency. When taken internally, CBD has been known to relieve a wide range of issues including insomnia, anxiety, headaches, muscle and joint pain, and even cancer (see \u201CWhat is CBD?\u201D for further information).\r\n\r\nVermont Green Magic Therapeutic Oil drops are crafted in very small batches over wood-fired heat during a gentle, two-day extraction process and have only two natural ingredients: whole plant CBD, and high-quality mild olive oil (organic coconut oil is available as an option for those who prefer it).\r\n\r\nOur full-spectrum Regular Strength formula is a good choice for folks who are sensitive to CBD or who have mild to moderate pain or insomnia. It is also a good choice for people who are interested in taking CBD preventatively, in order to support general health and nervous system function.\r\n\r\nOur full-spectrum Double Strength formula contains twice the CBD milligram count and is thus the better option for individuals who have stronger or more persistent issues, or for those who seem to require higher doses of CBD.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that many commercial CBD products tend to contain lab-isolated CBD, which has been industrially processed and isolated from the multitude of other beneficial cannabinoids naturally available in the hemp plant. Because the CBD cannabinoid itself has such a high profile of healing benefits, taking it in the form of isolate is still beneficial. However, isolated and commercially processed CBD will not be as naturally beneficial and available to the body as a product containing whole-plant, full-spectrum CBD \u2013 complete with its dozens of other beneficial cannabinoids, all of which have important benefits for the human body (and many of which are still being discovered). At Vermont Green Magic, all our products contain the highest quality full-spectrum CBD, for we believe the hemp plant has much more to offer than just one or two cannabinoids.\r\n\r\nDosage and Use\r\n\r\nEveryone\u2019s body is different. Thus, we encourage people to experiment in order find the dosage of CBD that is optimal for them. However, studies show that CBD tends to work best when it builds up in the body, and therefore we recommend at least taking CBD daily in both the morning and evening. The drops may be taken with food but may also be taken on their own.\r\n\r\nIf this is your first time taking CBD therapeutic oil, start out with 3 drops under the tongue. If after a few minutes you don\u2019t feel any change, try taking about 3 more. Then, taking 5-6 drops under the tongue in the morning and evening is recommended (though more may be taken, and more often, for persistent or more acute issues).\r\n\r\nJust as with many other naturally-based products, our Therapeutic Oils and salves are unfiltered. Because we use the whole plant rather than lab-processed isolate, it is normal to find occasional, tiny particles of CBD material in our products.",

Many nutrient companies lead people to believe that excessive phosphorous will result in higher yields; unfortunately, super-high levels of phosphates (aside from being harmful to the earth) are lethal to crucial soil microbes and bacteria. Not only does our balanced Bloom Dazzler give plants the nitrogen necessary for increased growth, but more importantly, it gives your plants the necessary potassium for bulking up flowers, and increasing root production during this time.\r\n\r\nNew root production throughout the flowering cycle means that calcium \u2013 only absorbed by newly advancing root tips \u2013 can more readily be taken up by the plant. Calcium is necessary for stronger cell wall structure and increased overall growth and support, but even more importantly: without calcium, other nutrients are less mobile throughout the plants, and become therefore less available. Calcium helps in the metabolizing of all other nutrients \u2013 it is that important.   \r\n\r\nBloom Dazzler is both a balanced and enriched nutrient for your plants, but we also know that dazzlingly high microbe levels can contribute to as much as 15% greater yields, so our addition of a varied microbe spectrum and your home-brewing cycle is what truly sets it apart from the rest.\r\n\r\nBy mixing a tablespoon of sugar, molasses, or honey into a gallon of water containing Bloom Dazzler and allowing it to sit for 24 hours, microbes will have multiplied into the millions. We push the limits of balanced nutrition with highly activated microorganisms into a brew that delivers an instant rush of energy into your plants. The day after using Bloom Dazzler (especially in a contained indoor environment), you will notice a marked increase in terpene aromas. A little goes a long way, so resist over feeding!\r\n\r\nAdminister regularly during blooming cycle. Vermont Green Magic: put a little Magic in your Green.\r\n\r\nBloom Dazzler plant nutrients are supplementally enriched with mealworm frass, locally raised several towns over from us by the good folks at Vermont Mealworm Farm. In our trials, we were very impressed with the boost in vigor and vitality that our plants showed after adding the frass. We also observed greater upward growth with a stronger supporting and branching framework. The chitin in the frass combined with the silica from our Mineral Bliss Plant Ferment aided our plants in creating stronger cell walls. Stronger cell walls make for stronger branches, which are then able to support huge crops!     \r\n\r\nContains: Deep Woods Composted Tea*, Mineral Bliss Plant Ferment*, liquid bone meal, mealworm frass, leonardite, K2SO4, cal\/mag supplement, kelp, bacterial inoculant.

Then we add a variety of plants known for their bio-activating, growth-stimulating, mineral-rich and enzymatically active properties \u2013 such as silica-packed stinging nettles and deep rooted, growth-activating yarrow \u2013 allowed to ferment into a pungent, chloro-phylled living brew.\r\n\r\nNext, we add enormous amounts of certified organic kelp, boosting micro nutrients and trace minerals and giving your plants that sparkle of vitality. Kelpie GreenLove is an enhanced kelp product. Used regularly, it will increase lateral root development, giving your plants greater root uptake capacity.\r\n\r\nAs a foliar spray, Kelpie GreenLove increases mineral concentration in plant cells and breaks apical dominance, creating more budding sites during vegetative growth. For foliar-feeding, mix a 1\/2 teaspoon into your purest water. Mix well and spray leaves liberally. Put a little Magic in your Green.\r\n\r\nOur kelp begins its life floating around in the mineral-rich ocean, absorbing sunlight and minerals whose names we can barely pronounce \u2013 all vital for soil health and plant growth. For centuries, mermaids were believed to bring kelp to rocky shores, and farmers gathered this magical bounty to use on their fields in order to increase yields.\r\n\r\nUsing kelp regularly has numerous benefits. Kelp contains trace minerals not found on land but which are vital to certain plant functions, plus growth-stimulating hormones (such as auxin and cytokinin) that keep plants at their optimal growth. Known as a root-growth stimulator, kelp increases lateral root development for greater nutrient uptake.\r\n\r\nUse a ratio of two parts Deep Woods Brew to one part Kelpie GreenLove during the vegetative or growth stage to help protect plants from insect and fungal stress. When used regularly, watering with this ratio will provide both B vitamins and trace elements from the humates in the Deep Woods Brew, and hormones from the kelp that will synergistically combine together to make unique protective compounds for your plants.\r\n\r\nWe also added a potassium supplement for increasing root growth and overall yield, sulfur to assist in plant protein production, and magnesium for chlorophyll synthesis and support of bloom production.\r\n\r\nWhen used according to label instructions for foliar feeding, the compounds in Kelpie GreenLove will provide a dilute trace mineral boost while breaking apical dominance, reducing stretching, and increasing lateral branching.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with this ages-old mermaid tradition, we at Vermont Green Magic gather the purest water, source the best organic kelp, and slow-brew our nutrient into the finest kelp product found on land or sea! Vermont Green Magic: put a little Magic in your Green.\r\n\r\nContains: Mineral Bliss Plant Ferment*, organic kelp, K2SO4, magnesium sulfate. Baseline analysis: 0-0-2 + trace minerals.\r\n\r\n",

Deep Woods Brew brings the FUNK!\r\n\r\nWhen used during the growing cycle, Deep Woods Brew will enrich and liven your indoor or outdoor garden with deeply composted teas to keep high-energy plants healthy and strong. Put a little Magic in your Green.\r\n\r\nDeep Woods Brew is supplementally enriched with mealworm frass, locally raised several towns over from us by the good folks at Vermont Mealworm Farm. In our trials, we were very impressed with the boost in vigor and vitality that our plants showed after adding the frass. We also observed greater upward growth with a stronger supporting and branching framework. The chitin in the frass combined with the silica from our Mineral Bliss Plant Ferment aided our plants in creating stronger cell walls. Stronger cell walls make for stronger branches, which are then able to support huge crops!

You\u2019ve watered, you\u2019ve pinched, trained, pruned, fertilized, and everything else, and now comes the most delicate and important stretch. Botrytis molds lurk at every turn, and a heavy fertilizing hand also threatens to change sweet-tasting flowers into uninspiring, chemical-tasting \u201Cshwag\u201D.\r\n\r\nWe developed Tasty Harvest to help the grower fight late season pathogens, and to help plants fully ripen. This is the time to increase oil and terpene production, add final weight, and purge the flowers of all pungent fertilizer scents and tastes.\r\n\r\nOur Mineral Bliss Plant Ferment, in combination with bloom-supporting magnesium and sugar-producing sulfur, helps ripen and harden your flower buds in the final weeks. Since spraying is not an option during this time, a specially chosen, ultra-pure essential oil blend is added to systemically protect your plants from pathogens from the inside out. This blend is transported from the roots throughout the entire plant in just a few hours. Plus, it smells nice!\r\n\r\nTasty Harvest will give you rock-hard, delicious-smelling flowers that taste exactly like they\u2019re supposed to. Use every time you water right up till harvest.\r\n\r\nWhen finishing, all other fertilization should cease and plants should be exclusively given Tasty Harvest, which has everything needed to bring your harvest to its healthy maximum \u2013 bursting with oils and terpenes. Finish off your grow season with a bang!
