                small, family-owned business located in the foothills of the
                Green Mountains of central Vermont. We specialize in a premium
                CBD product line, micro-fermented plant nutrient line, and hardy
                field-grown perennials. Our two priorities are exceptional
                quality products and good old-fashioned, honest customer
                service.

                products unique. We cultivate our own CBD plants right here on
                our farm, where breezy mountain air, mountain spring water,
                living soil, micro-fermented fertilizers, plant genetics, and a
                gentle extraction process all contribute to the finest quality
                CBD products on the market.

            <p className="title_blue fw-bold fs-4">Air</p>

            <p>
                Our plants love our fresh mountain air! At 1800 feet of
                elevation, our mountaintop location gives our home-cultivated BD
                plants a unique advantage: breezy, high-altitude air exchanges
                result in vigorous and robust plants and deter mold and mildew -
                a common problem on many farms. Studies have shown that
                high-altitude breezes also contribute to high terpene profiles
                in hemp plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                What are terpenes? Aside from being the very compounds that give
                all plants their characteristic flavor, scent and color,
                terpenes in the hemp plant - of which at least one hundred have
                been identified so far - are now known to have powerful
                therapeutic properties of their own.
            </p>

            <br />

            <p className="title_blue fw-bold fs-4">Water</p>

            <p>
                Water, water, water! Our CBD plants are grown with water right
                from our own mountain springs, which come from ancient aquifers
                that are clear and pure, and grow our plants into something
                pretty Spectacular.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p className="title_blue fw-bold fs-4">Living soil</p>

            <p>
                Soil is all-important. Without a dynamic and living soil, a
                plant cannot properly take up the nutrients it needs in order to
                grow into a vigorous, vibrant, high-CBD yielding plant. Forget
                hydroponics and chemical fertilizers!

                <span className="content_purple fw-bold">Magic&nbsp;</span> know
                what CBD plants want: we brew our own line of plant nutrients,
                from root support to a mineral-rich flower-booster. Our line of
                nutrients help dazzle our plants into bigger, stronger and more
                fragrant CBD plants, making the superior CBD salves and oils
                that our customers expect and rely on.

            <p className="title_blue fw-bold fs-4">Genetics</p>

            <p>
                Genetics matter. Our meticulously selected high-CBD seeds grow
                into robust, fragrant, and early-flowering plants, just the
                characteristics we expect from our special, cold-hardy strains.
                The cultivated varieties we grow are proven for their winning
                traits in our shorter, high-altitude growing season: bursting
                with aromatic oils, they are naturally disease-resistant and
                carry exceptional BD and terpene profiles. There's no question
                that the genetics of the happy CBD plants that thrive on our
                mountaintop absolutely make for superior BD salves and oils.
                That's the

                difference.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p className="title_blue fw-bold fs-4">Extraction</p>

            <p>
                Extraction is one of the most important aspects of a CBD salve
                or therapeutic oil. When all the compounds of a whole hemp plant
                are extracted in a gentle, two-day cycle over low, wood-fired
                temperatures, magical things happen: the properties of the plant
                are made assimilable to the human body through a process called
                "decarboxylation." Lab-isolated BD hasn't undergone this
                process! Our products are truly full spectrum: they contain the
                fully beneficial whole spectrum of the plant's cannabinoids and
                terpenes that are now known to be so important in supporting the
                body's functions.
            </p>

            <p>
                When a plant's cannabinoid and terpene profile is allowed to
                remain complete, the body is then better able to receive these
                important compounds, and they also interact together
                synergistically in the body.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most other BD products are made with processed, highly-extracted
                lab-isolated CBD, leaving out every other important cannabinoid,
                like CBN, CBG and CBC - just to name a few. Why throw all that
                good stuff away? Hemp is speculated to contain at least two
                hundred cannabinoids and terpenes, with more being discovered
                all the time. This means that most people are using commercial
                CBD preparations containing none of the other numerous
                beneficial cannabinoids and terpenes available in the hemp
                plant.
            </p>

            <p>
                In other words: 100 milligrams of CBD isolate can never match up
                to 100 milligrams of whole-plant CBD extract. When a CBD oil or
                salve is in its natural, whole-plant form, the body's
                endocannabinoid system can recognize, interact with and
                assimilate its many beneficial properties naturally.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our truly full-spectrum, hand-poured, micro-batch salves and
                oils literally make their way from our mountaintop into your
                home with all their integrity intact.

            <br />
            <p className="title_blue fw-bold fs-4">Stewardship</p>
            <p>
                Having a relationship to our BD plants is ever-important. We are
                constantly out in the field, monitoring our plants carefully for
                pests and molds - a serious problem among larger-scale BD
                growing operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most BD is coming from monoculture factory farms growing poor
                quality industrial hemp with poor land stewardship. Just like in
                other agricultural practices, monoculture crops mean pests and
                disease, leading to mold problems and the use of pesticides and
                fungicides. No one wants mold or fungicides in their CBD
                products! We believe in proper stewardship and we enact it: our
                soil is humming with a living biodiversity that stems from all
                our careful practices, and this rich and living soil is the soul
                and backbone of our high-vibing plants. Better for your health.
                Better for our planet's health.
